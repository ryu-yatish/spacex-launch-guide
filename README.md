the app is made in react js.
data was imported using fetch based on query from formcontrol, checkbox and select.

data displayed using material ui table with expandable details

the routing currently works in only one way due to some bugs, ie ?launchq=true will display sucessful launches but it does not get reflected on the UI checkbox. used react-router-dom.
